# CARSET SALES ANALYSIS

This project focuses on analyzing the Carseats Sales dataset from the ISLP (Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python) package to extract meaningful business insights and understand the factors influencing car seat sales performance. The analysis involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Key variables like price, advertising budget, store location, income levels, and competitor pricing were analyzed to identify their impact on sales. Various techniques including correlation analysis, feature comparison, and trend visualization were used to evaluate sales patterns and customer purchasing behavior. The project also explored how marketing strategies and demographic factors affect product demand. Overall, this project demonstrates strong skills in data analysis, business insight generation, and statistical interpretation, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies and market positioning.
